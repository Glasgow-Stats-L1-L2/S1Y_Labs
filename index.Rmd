## Intended Learning Outcomes {#ilo-intro}

* Be introduced to R and RStudio
* Be able to load in packages
* Be able to get help for packages and functions
* Be able to create objects by writing and running R code


## R and RStudio {#intro-r-rstudio}

R is a programming language that you will write code in and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working in R easier. Think of it as knowing English and using a plain text editor like NotePad to write a book versus using a word processor like Microsoft Word. You could do it, but it would be much harder without things like spell-checking and formatting and you wouldn't be able to use some of the advanced features that Word has developed. In a similar way, you can use R without RStudio but we wouldn't recommend it. RStudio serves as a text editor, file manager, spreadsheet viewer, and more. The key thing to remember is that although you will do all of your work using RStudio for this course, you are actually using two pieces of software which means that from time-to-time, both of them may have separate updates.


### Optional: Installing R and RStudio on your device {#intro-installing-r}

You do not need to install R or RStudio on your own laptop or desktop computer. You can complete these labs on the universities PCs, and these already have R and RStudio installed.  However, R and (basic) RStudio are free to download and install, and information is provided below if you wish to install both on your own device. If you already had R and/or RStudio installed, we recommend updating to the latest version before you work through this course. 

### Installing R 

![](images/R-Logo1.png){width=20%}

The first step is to install R on your own device. This can be done for free from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork). R is available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and some other less common operating systems. 

- If you are using a Windows device, you can [install](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) the latest version of R at the link and click '*Download R-x.y.z for Windows*. Once this is complete, run the installer and accept all default settings. 
- If you are using a Mac OS device, you can [install](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) the latest version of R at the link and select the .pkg file. Once this has downloaded, open the file and complete the on-screen steps to finish installing R. 

### Installing RStudio

![](images/RStudio.jpg){width=20%}

Now that R is installed on your device, you are ready to download and install RStudio. 

To do this, go to [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and click on the link '*Download RStudio...*', This should automatically detect what operating system your device is using, but do double check it says either for Windows or Mac OS (or another system you are using) - whichever is correct!

The file may take a few seconds to download, but once it has launch the installer and follow the steps to complete the installation. 

You are now ready to use RStudio. Make sure you launch the **RStudio app** to complete the labs, rather than R.  

## RStudio Quickstart Guide {#rstudio_ide}

The R software gives the computer the ability to process the R programming language. We will never use that software directly. Instead, we will use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com){target="_blank"}, an integrated development environment (IDE) which runs R for us via a graphical user interface (GUI) . 

To open RStudio from the University PCs:

- Open the "Maths-Stats" folder on the desktop.
- Open the "RStudio" programme from this folder. 

To create a text file (which we call an "R script") to write your R code in, select from the menu:

- File > New File > R Script

To save the R script file, go to

- File > Save

A dialogue box will appear asking where on the computer you would like to save your file. 

Save this R script file by navigating to a drive letter (e.g. H: or M:) or to a USB stick you have brought with you and save it with a relevant filename, e.g. "S1Y_Lab_1". **IMPORTANT: DO NOT navigate to ANY folders like "Documents" or "Desktop"**.

Once saved in a `.R` script file, you can use your code again, so there's no need to type it in a second time. If you close RStudio and then open it again, you can read in your code by going to 

- File > Open File...

and find the code file from the location where you saved it.

The RStudio IDE is arranged with four windows.

```{r img-rstudio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The RStudio IDE"}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/rstudio.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("images/first-open-RStudio.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("images/Opened-RScript.jpg")
```

By default, the upper left pane is the **source pane**, where you view, write, and edit code from files and view data tables in a spreadsheet format. When you first open RStudio, this pane won't display until we open a script file (like we did above) or load in some data. We 'run' (i.e. execute) code in the script file by selecting the row(s) we want to run and then clicking the `Run` icon OR by holding down the `ctrl` (or `command` in Mac) key and `Enter` at the same time. The results of executing the code (if any) appear in the lower left pane.

The lower left pane is the **console pane**, where you can type in commands and view output messages. You can write code in the console to test it out. The code will run and can create objects in the environment, but the code itself won't be saved. You need to write your code into a script in the source pane to save it.

The right panes have several different tabs that show you information about your code. The most used tabs in the upper right pane are the **Environment** tab and the **Help** tab. The environment tab lists some information about the object that you have defined in your code. We'll learn more about the Help tab in Section\ \@ref(function-help).

In the lower right pane, the most used tabs are the **Files** tab for directory structure, the **Plots** tab for plots made in a script, the **Packages** tab for managing add-on packages (see Section\ \@ref(packages)), and the **Viewer** tab to display reports created by your scripts. You can change the location of panes and what tabs are shown under **`Preferences > Pane Layout`**.

<!-- ### Reproducibility {#intro-reproducibility} -->

<!-- In this class, you will be learning how to make reproducible reports. This involves writing scripts that transform data, create summaries and visualisations, and embed them in a report in a way that always gives you the same results. -->

<!-- When you do things reproducibly, others (and future you) can understand and check your work. You can also reuse your work more easily. For example, if you need to create a report every month with the social media analytics for your company, a reproducible report allows you to download a new month's data and create the report within seconds. It might take a little longer to set up the report in the first instance with reproducible methods, but the time it saves you in the long run is invaluable. -->

<!-- ::: {.try data-latex=""} -->
<!-- Appendix\ \@ref(rstudio-settings) shows you how to change two important settings in the global Options to increase reproducibility. Your settings should have: -->

<!-- * Restore .RData into workspace at startup: `r mcq(c("Checked", answer = "Not Checked"))` -->
<!-- * Save workspace to .RData on exit: `r mcq(c("Always", answer = "Never", "Ask"))` -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ### Themes and accessiblilty -->

<!-- You can customise how RStudio looks to make it work for you. Click `Tools` - `Global Options` - `Appearance`. You can change the default font, font size, and general appearance of RStudio, including using dark mode. Play around with the settings and see what you prefer - you're going to spend a lot of time with R, it might as well look nice! -->


<!-- ## Sessions {#intro-sessions} -->

<!-- If you have the above settings configured correctly, when you open up RStudio and start writing code, loading packages, and creating objects, you will be doing so in a new session and your Environment tab should be completely empty. If you find that your code isn't working and you can't figure out why, it might be worth restarting your R session. This will clear the environment and detach all loaded packages - think of it like restarting your phone. There are several ways that you can restart R: -->

<!-- * Menu: Session > Restart R -->
<!-- * <span class=\"apple\">Cmd-Shift-F10</span> or <span class=\"windows\">Ctl-Shift-F10</span> -->
<!-- * type `.rs.restartR()` in the console -->

<!-- Try doing each of these now. Additionally, now would be a good time to create a notebook where you can keep a record of useful hints and tips and things to try when your code isn't working. Add "restart R session" to this notebook as your first item.  -->


## Skip to Section 3 "Part 2 - Analysing Data"

The next section (2. "Getting started using RStudio") is for reference for you to look at in your own time. In the lab, we will go straight to Section 3 "Part 2 - Analysing Data" and continue working from there.
